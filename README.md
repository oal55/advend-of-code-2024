Notes etc


## Qs
- Can I iterate on primitive containers and get values instead of references?
- Ways to throw, error out more elegantly (than `std::process::exit(1)` and eprintln ðŸ« 

## Add
- Something that downloads input files if they're not already saved
- The run function in main should probably be able to consume generic "runnable" functions (as upcoming days' results could have different types).
